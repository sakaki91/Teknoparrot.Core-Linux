# Teknoparrot.Core-Linux
This project uses Teknoparrot completely adapted for the Linux kernel, using the Wine utilities!  

This project is 100% free and open source, and aims to help preserve arcade game emulation in a way that is compatible with Linux, attempting to decouple as much as possible from the NT Kernel.
