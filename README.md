# Teknoparrot.Core-Linux
This project uses Teknoparrot completely adapted for the Linux kernel, using the Wine utilities!  

This project is 100% free and open source, and aims to help preserve arcade game emulation in a way that is compatible with Linux, attempting to decouple as much as possible from the NT Kernel.

Primary dependencies: `bash, wget, git, wine, winetricks`

    $ cd Teknoparrot.Core-Linux/
    $ chmod +x install.sh
    $ ./install.sh

### Currently supported games:

__Initial D: Arcade Stage 7AXX__, (You need to install [xact](https://github.com/sakaki91/Teknoparrot.Core-Linux/issues/1) in the prefix).  
__Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 6__ *(6, 6R & 6RR)*, Works out of the box!  
__DenshaDeGo!!__, Works out of the box! However, installing DXVK in the "Core" prefix is ​​highly recommended for better performance, as WineD3D may not be sufficient.
